# AKE-Minecraft-2024
### Rules
1. Don't be a douche and use common sense
2. No griefing, stealing, damaging trolling
3. No unconsensual pvp
### Installation
1. Install MultiMC Launcher (https://multimc.org/)
2. Configure default setup
3. You'll likely need to manually install Java 17 for modern Minecraft. Pay close attention to the file path it's downloading to and keep it in mind or take a snapshot of it before proceeding. (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17)
4. In MultiMC Launcher, Go to Settings, Java, set your file path to C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-17/bin/javaw.exe or wherver your Java 17 javaw file is (the listed path should be the default)
5. Make sure you up the maximum ram. you'll probably need at least 4 GB, I recommend adding 8GB if you have enough
6. On the MultiMC Launcher home page, right click and create new instance, then load from zip, download the zip from this github repository. If this download doesnt work, let me know.
### Resource Packs / Shaders
Completely optional but Iris is installed so why not if your PC can handle it!
* Arman's choice of vanilla tweaks https://vanillatweaks.net/share#bT6auR
* Arman's choice of shader - default enhanced https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/
Feel free to use whatever you want obviously lol.
